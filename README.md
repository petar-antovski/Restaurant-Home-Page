# Restaurant-Home-Page

In this project I designed a home page for a restaurant consisting of a navigation tab with 4 links and a body that consists of 2 sections, with the second section having 3 subsections. 

CSS pseudo classes were used to make the webpage interactive.

A CSS animation was used to animate a rotating clock symbol.
